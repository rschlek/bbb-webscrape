Project to web scrape bbb.org business

# Project Overview

1. Go to the Better Business Bureau website
2. Locate all the listings for roofing contractors in Macon, Georgia
3. Build a crawler in Python (use any framework/library you choose) that will extract the following
data points for each roofing contractor, while also filtering out all “waterproof” and
“waterproofing” contractors:
● Company name
● Phone number
● Address with street, city, state, and zip code
● Company Website (if available)
● Email Address (if available)
● BBB Rating
● Accredited Date (if available)
● Profile page URL
● (Any other information you think is good to have/relevant)
4. Export results in .csv format
5. Make a new column in your results file. In that column, please rank the results based on which
businesses you think would have the highest close rate for our sales department
6. Write a 3-5 sentence explanation on your thought process and why you ranked the results the
way you did
7. Write a 3-5 sentence explanation for the following question: If you came across a website where
there were no phone numbers on the company profiles, what alternative methods would you
employ to find them?
